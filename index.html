We are facing the harshest winter our people have ever experienced. We will only survive the coming period of hardship if everyone who has so far been spared from real suffering remembers their duty to humanity and active neighborly compassion."

The extreme cold—plummeting to as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius—combined with heavy snowfall and drifting snow, severely affected all residents around the turn of the year 1946/47, especially refugees who were forced to live in makeshift shelters, unheated attic rooms, and slum-like conditions. By late November 1946, it had already become apparent that heating shortages would pose a serious problem, as the supply of firewood for households was insufficient. This winter was particularly devastating for the sick, the elderly, and small children.

Due to the persistent freezing temperatures, the Christmas holidays for schoolchildren were extended into February 1947, with classes only held for final-year students. Many planned cultural events, such as performances at the Schlosstheater, were canceled. In some unheated rooms, temperatures dropped as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius.

A full-scale supply crisis loomed over Wolfenbüttel. Coal allocations were almost entirely cut off, and no upper or lower body clothing could be distributed at all. Despite snowstorms, mothers and children often stood for hours in long queues outside bakeries and dairy shops.

Even in the spring, food rations had to be drastically reduced. By March 1947, Wolfenbüttel’s bakeries faced a severe shortage of rye and wheat flour, forcing them to rely on cornmeal instead.

To improve the nutrition of young people, school meals—known as the Hoover School Feeding Program—were introduced in Wolfenbüttel in November 1947, providing approximately 5,000 portions daily. </p>
